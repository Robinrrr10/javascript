Document Object Model (DOM)

Element node - different html tags
Attribute node - different attribute in each tag
Text node - text which is needs to display

Eg:
<div id="mypage">How are you</div>

here div is element node
id is attribute node
"How are you" is text node



visual stdio and chrome is enough for learning

To add javascript code, we can use <script> tag in html  
We can directly write code inside <script> tag or else we can call .js file in script

<script type="text/javascript">  // default it will take text/javascript only. but it is better to mension type

</script>

Eg:
<script type="text/javascript">
	document.write("Hollo world")
</script>

document is the object of entire html
write() is the inbuild method of document

document.write("<h1>Hollo world<h1>")



We can write <script> tag in any where in html
if it has more lines of javascript code better add at end of the html file. this will improve performance


To include .js external file, use src attribute inside script tag then give name of the file
<script src="myfile.js" type="text/javascript">

</script>


; semicolon is used to seperate the statement

single line command should be in double slash // then command
multi line command should be in /* multiple lines */
