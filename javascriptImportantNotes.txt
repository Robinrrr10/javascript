node js is used for backend
react js is used for frontend
react js is used for web and mobile application
react native is used for android and ios application
angular js is used for mvc model. used for single page application
electron js used to build cross platform for desktop applications(build with javascript, html and css)
react vr used to create virtual reality applications
tensorflow js used for machine learning framework


HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT

Document Object Model (DOM)

Element node - different html tags
Attribute node - different attribute in each tag
Text node - text which is needs to display

Eg:
<div id="mypage">How are you</div>

here div is element node
id is attribute node
"How are you" is text node



visual stdio and chrome is enough for learning

To add javascript code, we can use <script> tag in html  
We can directly write code inside <script> tag or else we can call .js file in script

<script type="text/javascript">  // default it will take text/javascript only. but it is better to mension type

</script>

Eg:
<script type="text/javascript">
	document.write("Hollo world")
</script>

document is the object of entire html
write() is the inbuild method of document

document.write("<h1>Hollo world<h1>")



We can write <script> tag in any where in html
if it has more lines of javascript code better add at end of the html file. this will improve performance


To include .js external file, use src attribute inside script tag then give name of the file
<script src="myfile.js" type="text/javascript">

</script>


; semicolon is used to seperate the statement

single line command should be in double slash // then command
multi line command should be in /* multiple lines */

//use live server extension in visual studio. we no need to reload the browser. just click live, it will reload automatically'



Data type in javascripts:
---------------
1. primitive datatypes
2. trivial/other  datatypes
3. Composite datatypes

Primitive datatypes:
--
Number
String
Boolean

Trivial / other datatypes:
-------
null
undefined

Composite datatypes:
-----------
Objects
Arrays



Javascript is loosely typed programming language
Javascript is dynamically typed scripting language



var num = 34;
var name = "Ram";
var isName = true;

var x; //declaration
x = 12; //initialization

variable name should not be predefined keyword
variable name can start with letter, underscore _ or dollor $
case sensitive

even we dont give var keyword, it will still work
Eg: num = 78     //but this will be global variable

to show alert message in browser
alert("message");


Operators:
-----------
Arithmetic operators +, -, *, /, %, ++, --
comparison operators ==, ===, !=, >, <, >=, <=
logical operators (relation operator) &&, ||, !
assignment operators =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, <<=, >>=, >>>=, &=, ^=, |=, **=
conditional operators (ternary) ? :
string operators +   "Jhon" + "Mohan"   JhonMohan
type operators   typeof, instanceof
bitwise operators  &, |, ~, ^, <<, >>, >>>


Control statement
----------------
conditions:
if else
switch

looping:
for loop
while loop
do while loop
for in loop

others:
break
continue

in javascript switch case can accept number, string or boolean value

inside switch input we can do some operation also Eg: switch(num + 2)



for loop
for(;;) - this is infinite loop. 


Functions:
---

function nameOfFunction()
{

}

funcation with paramter:
function add(a, b)
{

}

function with return type:
function add(a, b)
{
  var tot = a + b;
  return tot;
}



local & global variables:
variable created inside function is local variable. It can be used with in the function
variable created outside the function is global variable. It can used inside and outside the function




arrays:
--
var cars = ["bmw", "swift", "volvo"];
or
var cars = new Array("bmw", "swift", "volvo");



Object:
-


Dom manipulation:

onclick  



Debugging:
----

In developer tool:
Elements: will show the code of the web page and when hover it will high light
Console: It is used to print console log. we can also use for some operation
Source: It is for deugging. Eg: we can add some debug point and go step by step

console.log("give logging string here");  //This is log in console

if there is some issue or error it will show in console
It will throw the exception in console
